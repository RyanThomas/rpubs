Here is how you do matrix multiplication for 3x3 matrices.
```{r}
matrixA <- matrix(c(3,2,4,7,5,0,1,0,8), ncol = 3, byrow=T)
matrixB <- matrix(c(6,1,0,2,8,7,3,4,5),ncol = 3, byrow = T)

matrixA%*%matrixB
```


Ok, here is the inverse of A.
```{r}
solve(matrixA)
```

And the determinent is:
```{r}
det(matrixA)
```


```{r}

```
